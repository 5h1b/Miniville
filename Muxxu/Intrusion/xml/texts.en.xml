	I disagree:
	contrary to that which has been said,
	it's true:
	yes, well, you are over-simplifying somewhat...
	no, I don't see why you'd say that.
	let's keep it simple...
	what I reckon is,
	you've got it all wrong.
	don't talk nonsense:
	in response to your mail,
	I received your mail, but
	I have news, but

	%techSujet% is complicated, but it's not %importance%.
	%techSujet% is an important subject:
	%bizObj% is the order of the day,
	<h2>The importance of %techSujet% in %bizObj%</h2>|
	<h2>%anySubject% Analysis</h2>|
	<h2>%anySubject% Research</h2>|

phrase
	%pintro% %bizPhrase%
	%pintro% %techPhrase%

bizPhrase
	%bizSujet% must function solely with %bizObj%.
	%bizSujet% must work in conjuction with %bizObj%, %bizObj% and %bizSujet% %techExtra%.
	%bizObj% is the only product of it's type on the market.
	the %bizSujet% situation vis a vis %bizObj% and %bizObj% allow us to estimate %bizObj% accurately.
	%bizSujet% could %raise% %bizObj%.
	%bizObj% will allow us to %expand% %bizSujet% using %bizObj%.
	negotiation on %bizObj% is %importance%.
	using %bizObj% is as of now %useless%.
	if we switch %bizObj% and %bizObj%, the %bizSujet% could %expand% %bizObj%.
	%bizObj% on the market will allow for %bizObj% of %bizSujet%.
	%bizObj% must ensure %bizObj% of %bizSujet%.
	%bizSujet% must %expand% %bizObj% and %bizObj%.

techPhrase
	the whole problem with %techSujet% rests on %tech%: we must %expand% %techSujet%.
	%tech%, and therefore %tech%, could be integrated into %techSujet%.
	by weakening %tech%, we could generate %techFailure%, which would strengthen %tech%.
	%techSujet% means risking %techFailure% or %techFailure%.
	%tech% can cause %techFailure%, so %techSujet% cannot be applied.
	downgrading %tech% could cause %techFailure%.
	%techFailure% would probably cause %techFailure%.
	%techSujet% would lead us directly to %techSujet%.
	our position on %techSujet% must be made clear: %expand% %tech% is %importance%.
	the breakdown of %tech% must not lead to %techFailure%.
	use of %tech% in %techSujet% could be optimized by using %techSujet%.
	if we deploy %tech% on %tech%, %techSujet% will become %useless%.
	by rebooting %tech%, %tech% would multiply its %techExtra% exchange.
	in-depth analysis of %techSujet% is %importance%.
	the deployment of %tech% tends to cause %techFailure% or %techFailure%.
	%tech% loses part of its value if we take this point of view on %techSujet%.
	%techFailure% could have disasterous consequences for %bizObj%.
	%tech% will be %importance% if we avoid %techFailure%.
	%techFailure% is never %importance% if we factor in the risks inherent in %techSujet%.
