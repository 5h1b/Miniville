	+NICE+ all hell's breaking loose here, I could really use your help.
	+NICE+ I'm sorry to bother you with this.
	+NICE+ the %xml_texts:boss% is insisting that get this problem fixed...
	+AGGRESSIVE+ listen, I 've really got to fix this situation pronto.
	+CONFUSING+ %xml_texts:tech% has caused a %xml_texts:techFailure%.
	+CONFUSING+ %xml_texts:techFailure% is really complicating %xml_texts:techSujet%.
	+CONFUSING+ we need the ::techitem:: back online to avoid a %xml_texts:techFailure%, but you'll need to make it happen.
	+MENACE+ you wouldn't want to be held accountable for all this.
	+MENACE+ I'd really rather not get %xml_texts:yourBoss% involved.

	_TECH_ it's impossible to access the ::techitem:: directly from here.
	_TECH_ rather than sending a technician, surely we can figure something else out.
	_TECH_ the crash was less serious than we'd feared, but we need to fix it quickly.
	_WORK_ there's a chance this could affect our ability to function as a company.
	_WORK_ we can't authorise anythig if the paperwork isn't in order.
	_WORK_ some urgent documents are pending.
	_WORK_ I really need to get this report squared away for our Japanese client.
	_FEAR_ this problem needs fixing, and quickly.
	_FEAR_ the directors would like this resolved asap.
	_FEAR_ you are at the heart of the problem.
	_FEAR_ I'm calling to warn you.

h_assertBegin
	as you can imagine,
	you understand that
	in a nutshell,
	without going into all the details,
	here's the idea
	ok, so,
	hmm.. hang on... I was told that
	I'll check... well,
	ok wait... *pretend to look*

complicated
	it's quite complicated to explain.
	hmmm... how to explain...
	the problem is complicated:
	it's quite complex:
	the problem doesn't seem simple.

cut
	listen,
	listen, it's simple:

oops
	%hesitate% what I wanted to say is
	%hesitate% in truth
	%hesitate%

yes
	yes, absolutely
	yes
	exactly
	in truth, yes

no
	no
	no, not at all
	not really, no
	I don't think so

good
	very good.
	perfect,
	that's perfect:
	ok.
	awesome,

bye
	Bye.
	Call back later.
	I can't talk to you right now.

hesitate
	hmm...
	ok...
	you...
	...
	huh?
	ah?
	I...
	ah.
	erm,
	hmmm ?

contrary
	not at all,
	contrary to what you might think,
	prety much, yes:
	indeed:

sorry
	I understand, but
	I am sorry,
	sorry, but
	sorry about that. Nonetheless,
	so I'd imagine, but

explain
	long story short,
	here's the deal,
	well,
