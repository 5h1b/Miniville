	%n% nights in %thisBadPlace%...
	Seriously, %thisBadPlace% is a nightmare... I stayed %n% nights too.
	My stay? It was great at the start.
	I really don't know %thisBadPlace%...
	It looked really nice in the brochure!

	%transition% there was this THING... %animal%... with its terrifying yellow bug eyes...
	Have you ever been chased by %animal%?
	%transition% there was the "minor incident": %bigThing% destroyed %myPlace%.
	%transition% %animal% in %myPlace% tried to eat me.
	%transition% I found %animal% in %myPlace%.
	%transition% %bigThing% destroyed %myPlace%.
	%transition% %roomItem% tried to decapitate me...
	%transition% %roomItem% tried to kill me.
	%transition% %roomItem% flew across my room.
	I think I was attacked by %roomItem%.
	I spent the whole night trying to escape from %animal%.
	In the morning, I noticed I was missing a kidney.
	It was really strange to find %animal% in the coffee.

	A bit of advice: don't go there. Ever.
	I'm still wondering how I managed to make it out of there alive...
	I really thought I was going to stay there indefinitely.
	I have no idea how I made it out alive...
	I'd rather be run over by a truck than go back there.
