		Ever since Mandragore returned to the island, everyone is on the alert, a curfew is even in place.
		It is forbidden to go anywhere without permission. Not that that changes anything for me, I always have to stand guard.

		Bonjour à vous,
		[I'm Jobsworth, and I tell you, it's not an easy name to live with, but a busy life is a healthy life!]
		[I've been with the guard for 10 years, but now I'm the officer in charge of welcoming tourists to our beautiful island.
		Sometimes they even take photos with me!]
