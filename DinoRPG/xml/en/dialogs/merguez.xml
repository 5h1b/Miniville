		Oh la la! My merguez are extremely fatty! It was quite an odd idea to come and start selling merguez in such a dark and gloomy place?
		But those Ruins are absolutely magnificent! I'm certain that one day, millions of tourists will come and visit!

	<a id="ah">Oh really?</a>

		Yes, that's right! It's a bit like the Acre-o-Poles: my cousin makes a fortune there selling temple-shaped key rings.
		So I decided I would be the first merchant to set up shop at these magnificient ruins, even though it may take many years for my business to build up.
		There was no way I was going to let this opportunity pass me by!

		Take this Merguez. Your Dinoz is far too skinny! This one's on the house, as long as you do me a favour:
		promise me you'll tell your friends about the Ashpouk Ruins. Tell them all that I sell the best Merguez around.
		Promise me you won't forget?
