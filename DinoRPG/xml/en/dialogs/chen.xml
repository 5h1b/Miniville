		[Did you just say "Little dragon" in Arborian?
		Do you know the Archdorogon's grandson?]
		[My father was in the service of the former Archdorogon, he was a high priest. I used to see them often, and their disappearance made me really sad.
		I am what they call a sybil, a kind of doctor if you will. When I meet people on my travels who are in trouble, I help them.]

		I know who was responsible. Morg is one of Dorogon Grizorg's most powerful soldiers, 
		he uses poison extracted from an extremely venomous plant which can only be found here.]
		[Unfortunately, only the Archdorogon has the cure which can heal him.]
		[Your only chance is to find a way into the former Archdorogon's laboratory, he used to make potions there which could cure pretty much anything. I also practice the art, but I don't have his talent.]

		[There is a holy mountain at the opposite end of the island called Mount Everwest where the old Archdorogon used to brave the cold to test his latest formulae.]
