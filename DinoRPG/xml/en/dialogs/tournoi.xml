		Hello Grand Dinoz Master! The Great Tournament of BrutForce is open to all those who want to test their Dinoz against other players. Would you like to register?
	</phase>

	<a id="yes" cond="!fx(totem)">Yes, definitely!</a>
	<a id="ok" cond="fx(totem)">Yes, thanks!</a>
	<a id="no">Hmmm, no thanks ... I need to train my Dinoz</a>

	<phase id="yes">
		Unfortunately, it is specified in the official rules, paragraph 15.48 indent H:
		Only Dinoz who possess an ancient relic can access to the tournament.
		It is the only condition of participation ... don't hesitate to come back once your Dinoz has found one. Have a good day and a nice stay in BrutForce!
	</phase>

	<phase id="ok" effect="tourna">
		Oh! I see that your Dinoz has an {Ashpouk Totem}! Very well, I'll register him
		and he'll be included on the Tournament fighter list.
		Have a good day Dinoz Master!
	</phase>

	<phase id="no">
		Very well. No one is forcing you to register - especially if your Dinoz aren't ready to fight against stronger opponents. The Tournament can be very dangerous for ill-prepared Dinoz. Have a good day and enjoy your stay in BrutForce!
	</phase>
