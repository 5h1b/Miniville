		Hello young lady....(Wow)!

		Hello Dinoz master, my name is Anna Tomie, I've just arrived in Dinotown and I need your help.
	</phase>
	<a id="aide"> 
		Of course! What can I do for you ?

	<phase id="aide" next="blabla:info">
		Well, although I've just arrived in Dinotown and I am very talented, there's nowhere for me to work! I'd really like to build a clinic so I can help heal Dinoz...
		I've got permission from the King, but I haven't found the right place to build it yet........it seems no-one likes the idea of living next to a busy clinic!
	</phase>
	<a id="blabla">
		It might be a problem, but it's all for a good cause.

		You're not from Dinotown, are you?

	<phase id="info" next="bref">
		You're right, I actually come from a region in the north, but I decided to leave so that I could on my own. Psssssss! Anna Tomie isn't my real name, but don't tell anyone! I just wanted to blend in more. But that's not the point, were you even listening to me in the first place?
	</phase>
	<a id="bref" target="aide">
		Sorry, what were you saying?
	</a>
	<phase id="blabla" next="end">
		Well I was wondering if you wouldn't mind going around Dinotown for me and asking people where the best place to build a clinic would be... It would be really kind of you sweetie!
	</phase>
	<a id="end">
		I'll run, I'll fly, I'll jump....... but where should I go first?

		Anna has already left to talk to someone else. If you want to impress her, it would be better to keep quiet!

		It seems you're not the person I'm after......too bad.

		A clinic? That's a great idea, Dinotown doesn't have one at the moment,
		You'll need to find an isolated location for a building of that size... maybe you'd be better off looking in the west of the town?

		Good day!
		Allow me to guide you through our finest vintages, the pompelope 142 is succulent, l'extremitédeau 144 is extremely rare.

		Ah, but you're wrong! Once they've been cured, the patients will come to your shop to buy some wine!
