		I need some Amnesiac Rice to recharge my magic cape. I've been told that it grows in the Sticky Swamp of the Atlanteid Islands. Can you bring me enough Rice to recharge my cape so I can become invisible again? Hurry up, it's really important!

		After searching the Swamp for several hours, you finally find an area full of Amnesiac Rice, a rare variety of Rice with amazing properties! The only problem is that hundreds of Pirhanoz are protecting the entrance. You'll have find a way past them!

		To be honest, I didn't need the Amnesiac Rice, sorry! I only needed a little bit of lightning energy to recharge my cape ... here, take this as a reward. You can keep the rice too, I don't need it anymore.
