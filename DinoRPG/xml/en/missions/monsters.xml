			Hey! Do you think you could deliver something for me? It's not risky, all you need to do is follow my instructions carefully...

			Great! Here, take this black briefcase and deliver it to my cousin at the Market Place in Dinotown. He'll tell you what to do next...

		<action v="Black Briefcase">
			You pick up the black briefcase. You have no idea what's inside and don't want to know either!

			Hey! What's this?....It's from my cousin you say? He must be running a new scheme... Wait here for me, it'll take me a couple of hours to get the briefcase ready to give back to him, OK?
		</talk>
		<action v="Wait..." wait="3">
			You wait patiently for him to return...
		</action>
		<talk v="Shady Man" gfx="filou">
			Listen, we've had a slight problem, the briefcase still isn't ready yet. Wait here for me a little longer while I deal with it, OK?
		</talk>
		<action v="Wait..." wait="2">
			You continue to wait...less patiently...
		</action>
		<talk v="Shady Man" gfx="filou">
			OK, everything is ready, return the briefcase to my cousin as quickly as possible. I don't want to get screwed over just because it's a bit late!
		</talk>
		<action v="Black Briefcase">
			You pick up the briefcase. It seems a lot lighter than before, they must have switched the contents...
		</action>
		<goto v="mport"/>
		<talk v="Shady Man" gfx="filou">
			Thanks! See! I told you it wouldn't be risky!
		</talk>
		<end>
			Thanks, you've been a big help... in return I'll show you how to get past the guards.
