#line 51 
Saumir's twinner
During the synthesis of your first drilling ball, the twinner is activated and duplicates the ball.

#line 59 
Incomplete medallion
It's a small Zonkerian Medallion, it is incomplete.

#line 70 // Moltear
Rocky planet with a high molecular parasite activity. Old Zonkerian colony, many ruins can be seen in the southern hemisphere.

#line 73 // soupaline
Planet having similar characteristics to the Earth's. A standard terraformation procedure has recently been launched by ESCorp in order to set up a drilling colony in the near future.

#line 76 // Lycans
Giant volcanic planet, the high concentration of poutractive conglomerates makes its exploration dangerous.

#line 79 // Samosa
The bulkiest planet of the Zonkerian system. Its incredible density and its exceptional gravity transform any mining operation into an endless race of endurance.

#line 82 // Tiboon
Small-sized, desertic planet. Little mining resources are exploitable.

#line 85 // Balixt
Home planet of a highly technologically advanced extraterrestrial race. Being quite xenophobic, Balixteans have posted sentinels all through and around their territory, and will not tolerate any intrusions.

#line 88 // Karbonis
The explosion of the principal reactor of a gigantic mining industry caused Karbonis' heart to become unstable, and was followed by its implosion. An asteroid belt was created around the Zonkerian system called the \"Karbonis belt\".

#line 91 // Spignysos
Spignysos' surface temperature never exceeds -50Â°C. Icy winds on the surface alter any envelope's orientation matrix and make space mining more difficult. We call this phenomenon \"spignysian stasis\".

#line 94 // Pofiak
The presence of water and the temperate climate on Pofiak allowed tropical jungles to grow on its entire surface. Psionic insects can parasite your envelope's orientation matrix.

#line 97 // Senegarde
Gaseous planet. The presence of saturated frugi-nitrogen creates an incredibly fertile field for parasite molecules. They develop faster here than anywhere else.

#line 100 // Douriv
This planet is extremely rich in minerals, 75% of its surface is crystalized or in the process of crystalization. Naturally, it's the favorite destination of all space miners. Sadly, psionic insects infest the richest regions of Douriv.

#line 103 // Grimorn
It is a dead planet, its ground is poor and the presence of metallic conglomerates prevent any intensive mining.

#line 106 // D-Tritus
Dump planet where great monsters reside. They are organized in society and live by operating a planet in another galaxy. The technology that allows them to travel so far is still unknown.

#line 109 // Asteroide
Karbonis' asteroid belt: the old planet exploded which created a vast asteroid field...

#line 112 // Nalikors
A dry planet that has etheral vegetation. This planet is used as a rally point to all the anarchists of the universe. FURI is the represented movement, and it includes over 242 members in this sector.

#line 115 // Holovan
An old rocky planet, the Kemilians' home planet, a more than 120,000 year old civilization. In the aim of not being disturbed, the Kemilians filled the sky with Kashuat sentinels.

#line 118 // Khorlan
A grassy and comfortable planet. It is a friendly place to live in, several settlers decided to flee their galaxy's political problems and reach Khorlan. Only orbital-nut falls disturb their peaceful lives.

#line 121 // Cilorile
A planet with water and breathable atmosphere, Cilorile is avoided by most miners because of its guardian conglomerates. Their contact causes an immediate explosion of the envelope.

#line 124 // Tarciturne
This planet was devastated several years ago by a meteorite shower.

#line 127 // Chagarina
A limestone planet which died a few milleniums ago. Its advanced crystalization and its location far away in the Zonkerian system make it a premium destination for the miners.

#line 130 // Volcer
Planet with large dimensions, having enough water to provide shelter for various life forms. Even with a difficult access, Volcer attracts thousands of tourists coming from all surrounding systems every year.

#line 133 // Balmanch
Spiky-limestone planet of the voceronic type. The atmosphere's high starch saturation has caused a proliferation of orbital-nuts. Today, only high-skilled pilots can fly over Balmanch without risking an immediate crash.

#line 136 // Folket
Gaseous planet. Folket's core implosion over twenty thousand years ago led to a perpetual chlorine clay vaporization of its ground. The surface slicks' high acidity prevents envelopes lacking strong shields to reach its center.
