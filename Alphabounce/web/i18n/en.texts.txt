ESCorp entry test

#mission_desc_0
<p>Hello, prisoner ::name::,</p>

<p>Welcome to the ESCorp, the leader corporation in terms of <strong>prison mining extraction</strong>. We have just transferred your envelope into a non-exploited spatial zone. Your arrival <em>position</em> will be shown as <em>[COORD]</em>.</p>

<p>Remember that you will have to entirely clear this area in order to receive further instructions. We have also transferred <strong>three emergency envelopes</strong>, to help you train. Good luck, prisoner. Keep some hope and maybe one day you will be back amongst your kindred.</p>

#mission_end_0
Well done, you seem to have perfectly mastered the envelope. <strong>You may now travel through the universe</strong>.

#mission_name_1
Drilling license

#mission_desc_1
<p>In order to obtain your mining license and win your first drilling ball, you will have to collect all <strong>3 license levels</strong> located around your position.</p>

<p>Be sure <strong>not to leave the mission zone</strong>, the presence of ferrous conglomerates will prevent any attempt of escaping.</p>

#mission_end_1
Well done, you now possess a classic RCD-20 drilling ball. From now on, ferrous conglomerates can be destroyed.

#mission_name_2
A new colony

#mission_desc_2
<p>According to our scientists an inhabitable planet is located not far from your actual position. They call it '<em>Soupaline</em>'.</p>

<p><strong>Visit all territories on this planet</strong> to create a new colony on Soupaline.

Because the atmosphere is highly saturated with nitrogen, <strong>purple conglomerates</strong> appear. They can re-synthesize a few seconds after being drilled.</p>

#mission_end_2
<p>Well done, Soupaline is now under our control. We have transferred 200 Minerals and 12 Solid Hydrogen Capsules to your account.</p>

<p>Don't hesitate to discover other planets, ESCorp will be grateful if you provide some useful information about planets from this system...</p>

#mission_name_3
Distress call

#mission_desc_3
The envelope has detected a <strong>distress call coming from area <em>[COORD]</em></strong>. It seems the signal has been sent from a standard prison envelope.

#mission_end_3
<p>Thank you my friend, I owe you one. My name is <strong>Douglas</strong>. It's been nearly a century since I've been transferred by ESCorp to a planet named <strong>Samosa</strong>, located a few eons from here.</p>

#mission_desc_4
<p>We have detected an explosion in <em>Lycans</em>' atmosphere. It looks like a non-human ship has recently crashed on the planet's surface. ESCorp's laboratories are very interested in retrieving the debris of the vessel.</p>

<p>Luckily, you are very close to <em>Lycans</em>. The mission is simple, but be careful because the planet has a high level of volcanic activity. Help us <strong>collect the 7 debris parts</strong> marked on your map, and we will upload a permanent extension program to your envelope.</p>

#mission_end_4
Well done, prisoner ::name::. Thanks to your help, ESCorp laboratories will be able to find important information. <strong>The extension program</strong> has just been transferred, as promised, near your origin area <em>[COORD]</em>.

#mission_desc_7
Find the author of the strange drawings located on <em>Tiboon</em>'s dunes. Maybe he could help you learn more about the zone which you are in.

#mission_end_7
You have found a strange living being, he does not understand your language but seems to want to be part of your envelope. It is possible that you'll learn more about him on your journey...

#mission_name_8
Salmeen

#mission_desc_8


#mission_end_8
After several weeks, you manage to understand the language spoken by Tiboon's inhabitant. He tells you his name is Salmeen, and even if you can't understand what reason he was on Tiboon for, he seems very interested in your journey. His presence will be useful to find your way through the universe. To help you go on your trip, he offers you <strong>10 SHC</strong>.

#mission_name_9
Danger : Balixt

#mission_desc_9


#mission_end_9
As you progress, Salmeen seems more and more nervous. He uses your holographic card to indicate a planet he considers dangerous. Its name is <em>Balixt [COORD]</em> and it is controlled by and extra-terrestrial race. According to Salmeen, it is a combative race, but they must have informations or stellar artifacts that could ease your progression.

#mission_name_10
On the way to Balixt

#mission_desc_10
Traces of extra-terrestrial civilization have been detected near area <em>[COORD]</em>. This is a priceless chance for you to know where you are in the universe, and to find your way towards the Earth.

#mission_end_10
You are approaching Balixt. The planet's surroundings appear to be stuffed with <strong>reducines</strong>, which are small sentinels located on some conglomerates. Be careful and avoid their beams or your envelope will be reduced until the end of the mission.

#mission_name_11
Invasion

#mission_desc_11
<p>The <strong>reducines</strong> are slowing our progress in this sector. The Balixteans' open aggression leaves us no other option, we must hit them hard to subject the people of Balixt to the ESCorp.</p>

<p>We are counting on you for this mission. If you succeed, the ESCorp will officially ask for the payment of your term. Your imprisonment will then end and you will be put on photo-transit towards the Earth.</p>

#mission_end_11
<p>Well done. You have beaten all your enemies, the ESCorp's manager himself congratulates you for your bravery. However, even after multiple tries, our lawyers were not able to obtain the necessary authorization for your photo-transit towards the Earth.</p>

<p>This means you still have to go through your prison term. As a compensation, we have offered you a <strong>new emergency envelope</strong> which can help you in your hardest drilling sites.</p>

#mission_name_12
Abandoned missile

#mission_desc_12
We have detected the remains of a missile in the <em>[COORD]</em> sector. If you gather it we will be able to copy its molecular structure diagram into your envelope. This could highly increase your drilling capacity.

#mission_end_12
Well done. The missile contains enough information to be used by your envelope's synthetic engine. From now on, <em>you can send a missile by pressing the SPACE bar on your keyboard</em>. Find merchants or special conglomerates to recharge your missiles. If you collect other debris, your maximum missile number will be increased.

#mission_name_13
A new generator

#mission_desc_13
The generator delivered with your envelope only allows you to travel a single sector at a time. We know a Zonkerian merchant is currently in area <em>[COORD]</em>. He does not speak our language, but you should still try to bargain with him, maybe you'll get a more powerful generator.

#mission_end_13
Well done. From now on, you can go twice as far using only one hydrogen capsule. Don't hesitate to visit other merchants, their positions will now appear on your map.

#mission_name_14
Nothing stops the AR-57

#mission_desc_14
The CHMK study unit wishes to take a look at rock samples from the planets <em>Lycans[COORD]</em> and <em>Spignysos[COORD]</em>. Bring back a sample of each of these grounds and the ESCorp will allow you to test, as a preview, the synthesis of its <strong>explosive AR-57 missile</strong>.

#mission_end_14
Well done. The data obtained from studies on the AR-57 has been transferred to your envelope and the rocks collected from Lycans and Spignysos will allow you to synthesize more destructive missiles from now on.

#mission_name_15
The Genemill

#mission_desc_15
An important generator prototype has been lost by the army over 50 years ago in area <em>[COORD]</em>. The Genemill can provide enough energy to cover the needs of an entire planet, we would like to find it in order to study how it works.

#mission_end_15
Well done, prisoner ::name::! We have just received the Genemill. A broad study will surely help us imagine future equipment for your envelope.

#mission_name_16
Star dust

#mission_desc_16
<p>

A Zonkerian legend says a <strong>gigantic interstellar blob</strong> lived in this galaxy long ago. Its size was humongous, and it created star eclipses as it made its way through space. Its development was such that Asteroplankton did not fulfil its needs for long. The blob then started to eat surrounding planets, being the cause of much panic and disorder through the galaxy.

</p>

<p>

It was later hunted by the dominant antekemilian races of the time, who destabilized its metabolism by injecting it with several toxic products, causing its structure to slowly fall apart. <em>Seven organs shaped as stars</em> were kept safe from the destruction, and they are now drifting through the universe. The legend also states that whoever can unite all symbols will be able to manipulate the universe's heart...

</p>

#mission_end_16
Congratulations. You have access to the power of manipulation of the world consequently. By clicking on the icon of edition you will be able to manipulate the conglomerates of the area and offer your new decor to humph... let us say... God.

Salmeen seems fascinated by <em>Moltear</em>'s surface. He hasn't left the relief scanner since the beginning of the week. He ends up showing you the position of a Zonkerian ruin. According to him, it contains a capsule of rare gas called <strong>Ambro-X</strong>. Injecting this capsule into your radar's external ionization circuits could help increase its range significantly.

Drilling ball: OX-Soldier

#mission_desc_21
<p>Good news, prisoner ::name::. Our research team has discovered a new material, which can make the parasite molecules infesting your sector's atomic structures burst.</p>

<p>Reach <em>Moltear</em> to pick up the items needed for synthesizing your new drilling ball!</p>

#mission_end_21
<p>The OX-Soldier is yours. Molecules will now explode upon contact with your drilling ball, this should help you in your progression through the universe.</p>

Drilling ball: OX-Delta

#mission_desc_22
<p>Bad news, prisoner ::name::: we have developed an explosive drilling ball. Its power is twice that of your current ball. Unluckily, it was accidentally transferred to a position quite far from yours: <em>[COORD]</em>.</p>

<p>This position is outside Karbonis' belt. As you already know, <strong>NO prisoner is allowed to travel through the asteroid belt</strong>. Forget about this ball and return to your local mining activities.</p>

#mission_end_22
After a long trip, the OX-Delta is finally in your possession. You can bore the most resistant conglomerates twice as fast! However the OX-Delta is not the most powerful ball of the Zonkerian system... Are you clever enough to find the ultimate drilling ball?

#mission_desc_23
Hello comrade ::name::. The troups of our Stukleen allies managed to destroy and ESCorp convoy far in the South-East of your current location. It seems that a <strong>highly valuable prototype</strong> was present in that convoy, but we suddently lost contact with our team when they entered the main ship. Five hours later, we recorded a destructive wave of many thousands of Dhz. Based on our calculations, the wave’s origin can be found at hundreds of sectors at <em>[COORD]</em>. Go see what’s happening out there, we need to understand what was in that ultra-secret shipment.

Salmeen the mechanic step 1

#mission_desc_29
After studying the structure of your envelope, Salmeen thinks he can modify it and enable you to fly over planets. In order to do this, he needs elements which he thinks can be found on spaceship wrecks to the east of the origin point. The first part is located at <strong>[COORD]</strong>.

#mission_end_29
Using elements taken from the wrecks, Salmeen was able to improve your envelope's external shield and install a <strong>surface engine</strong>. You can now explore planets by entering their atmosphere. However, you must be careful for each entry in a planet's atmosphere will consume a hydrogen capsule. Don't forget to save some fuel in order to return to outer space!

<p>Now that you can fly over planets, you need to be able to land on them. Salmeen can try to build landing pods by dismantling one of your emergency envelopes. It's a big sacrifice, but shouldn't it be worth it?</p>

<p>If you decide to <strong>sacrifice one of your emergency envelopes</strong> to allow for this modification, go to the shop located to the west of Soupaline, at <em>[COORD]</em>.</p>

#mission_end_30
By dismantling one of your emergency envelopes, Salmeen managed to add <strong>landing pods</strong> to your envelope. Try them out and go for a walk on <em>Soupaline</em>! Be careful when landing, pick a cleared zone and try to be gentle!
