Hello human prisoner,\n

#line 369 
Hello,\n

#line 370 
Hello stranger,\n

#line 371 
Welcome stranger,\n

#line 372 
I have been waiting for your visit for so long...\n

#line 373 
Finally, a visitor!\n

#line 374 
Grumph!\n

#line 375 
Hola! Is someone there?\n

#line 376 
Who's there?\n

#line 377 
Hello!\n

#line 381 
My name's ::name::, I am ::profession:: on this planet.

#line 382 
My name's ::name::, we can be friends if you want.

#line 383 
I'm a humble ::profession::.

#line 384 
They call me ::name:: the ::profession::.

#line 385 
My name's ::name::, do you want to be my friend?

#line 386 
My name's ::name::, I don't have a lot of ::miss:: since I am ::profession::.

#line 387 
Who are you? I am ::name:: the ::profession::.

#line 391 
I've been wanting to leave ::start:: for years now...

#line 392 
I don't like ::start:: as much as I used to,

#line 393 
::start::, it's really a bad place to live in,

#line 394 
There is nothing interesting to do on ::start::,

#line 395 
Do you think you could live on ::start::? Because personally I'm done here...

#line 396 
There aren't many people around here... If this goes on I'll lose my job.

#line 401 
I know it from deep inside, a better life awaits me on ::end::.

#line 402 
Maybe I could start everything over on ::end::.

#line 403 
I've always dreamt of going to ::end::

#line 404 
My dream is to go on ::end::

#line 408 
I need to find my keychain... I've lost it while travelling around ::pos::.

#line 409 
My project is to build a new space colony on ::pos::.

#line 410 
I'd like to open a new space shop on ::pos::.

#line 411 
If you could bring me to ::pos::, I could find my uncle there, he owns a satellite-burger around.

#line 412 
I've heard of a great astro-night-club on ::pos::.

#line 413 
Boxes of ::stuff0:: have been abandoned at ::pos::, I'd like to get there as fast as possible!

#line 414 
I know from a certain source that ::singer:: will give a surprise show on ::pos:: this week.

#line 418 
Can you bring me there?

#line 419 
Will you help me travel all the way there?

#line 420 
May I travel with you until we get there?

#line 421 
May I go with you?

#line 425 
I will have to use one of your envelopes to travel with you.

#line 426 
I need one of your emergency envelopes to follow you, I'm too big to fit in with you.

#line 430 
If you take me I can give you ::rmin:: minerals.

#line 431 
I can pay the fare ::rmin:: minerals.

#line 435 
That's all my savings!

#line 436 
I have nothing else.

#line 437 
You don't have to take everything...

#line 438 
I hope it's enough.

#line 443 
I don't have money to pay the fare, but I'm sure you'll do it heartfully...

#line 447 
I also have something to help you for the fuel: ::rcap:: SHCs!

#line 448 
For the fuel I also have ::rcap:: SHCs, that should help us travel a bit.

#line 451 
\nBut you can't do anything for me...\nThanks for visiting anyway. It feels good to speak to someone.

#line 455 
Space molecules make our lives impossible... Yesterday they walled my living room.

#line 456 
Molecules are multiplying very quickly around here, I think it's time to leave.

#line 457 
It's so annoying! The molecules destroyed my ::stuff0:: again this morning. I have no reason to stay here.

#line 460 
Soupaline's marine air never did any good to me, and I also think the salt started to erode my brain.

#line 464 
::start:: is really too unstable for me, yesterday the ::stuff0:: delivery boy was sent on orbit after a surface explosion!

#line 465 
Do you think you could live on ::start::? There's 20 explosions each night here!

#line 466 
I've lost 13 Shmolgs since the beginning of the year... All this because of ::start::'s sulfur explosions.

#line 470 
Sand, sand, sand... There's nothing else here...

#line 471 
I've explored all of ::start::'s dunes, I think it's time for me to move on to something else.

#line 474 
Balixteans are oppressing and vindicative, the situation here is horrible!

#line 475 
Yesterday Franxis was directly hit by one of their nasty reducines, and I haven't found him back!

#line 476 
Balixt's new governor makes life conditions inacceptable to strangers.

#line 480 
::start::, it's kind of dead during winter, if you know what I mean...

#line 481 
Have you seen this ugly weather? No way I'm staying on ::start:: any longer!

#line 482 
Last night the temperature fell down to -50°C, I've lost a toe...

#line 483 
My ::stuff0:: froze last night!

#line 486 
::start:: is way too humid for me, I think I'll end up sick if I stay here.

#line 487 
The psionic insects' ongoing attacks persuaded me to leave ::start::.

#line 492 
There are way too many miners coming here, soon ::start:: will be covered in autonomous mining complexes!

#line 497 
The planet's olfactive quality is degrading, which removes eating kids as one of my pleasures...

#line 500 
The life of a hermit lost on an asteroid is getting boring.

#line 503 
Every day, there are more ESCorp RAIDs, I think my life is in danger here.

#line 504 
I came here to join the F.U.R.I. but Kefrid's megalomaniac attitude makes me hesitate...

#line 507 
I started my transcendental meditation internship with the Kemilians over 37 years ago.

#line 508 
Since I finished my studies, nothing holds me back on Holovan.

#line 511 
I want to travel through the universe, just like Salmeen!

#line 512 
Orbital-nut falls have completely destroyed my village, only my house still stands up! I don't want to stay here!

#line 515 
Because of the guardian conglomerates, we have to stay put every day between 9:00 and 9:20 in the morning and between 6:30 and 6:50 in the evening. This isn't living, I want to leave Cilorile!

#line 523 
Space molecules look very interesting, I think I'll be able to study them once I get there.

#line 526 
Having ocean in sight leaves me dreaming...

#line 529 
Open spaces... There's nothing better!

#line 533 
It will be more quiet here than on that tiny planet.

#line 536 
Balixteans need workforce to build their empire. Surely they'll need some ::profession:: there.

#line 537 
The reducine installations need a lot of workforce. Surely I'll find a job there.

#line 541 
We're suffocating here, I need some fresh air.

#line 542 
They say the surface is so bright that you can barely open your eyes!

#line 545 
I need a little vegetation.

#line 550 
They say that over there, all you have to do is bend over to pick up crystals! Doesn't that excite you?

#line 551 
I could easily be rich over there, it seems like the surface is covered in crystals!

#line 555 
I heard you could start a career just by scaring children over there!

#line 561 
Joining F.U.R.I. members for adventure, that's quite an experience!

#line 564 
My dream is to find and live with the Kemilians.

#line 567 
I need a little vegetation.

#line 570 
Marine air: it's good for what I have!

#line 581 
Hello Salmeen!\nIt's been a while since we last saw each other! Do you need something? I see you've brought a friend, I'll see if I can find what you're looking for.\n*Gregune opens a big chest at the back of the room*\nHere, its a Suptirnean suit, which means there is an extra pair of sleeves in the back that won't be very useful to you, but it should be functional. It is equipped with a jetpack which will allow you to move around easier. Good luck to both of you and see you soon!

#line 583 
Welcome companion!\nThe RCEH needs all available souls to fight human expansion. We have no discriminatory policies and your human origins are not an obstacle to you joining our cause. You can now participate in prisoner rescue and ESCorp equipment sabotage operations in this system.\nThank you for your help!

#line 585 
Noyaguld stranger! I am Saumir.\nThe Kemilians are happy to welcome you among them. Our people came to Holovan thousands of years ago, we do not wish to participate in your ethnic tatelbs. Young civilizations like yours have to progress step by step up the ladder of history to understand the great Koshmerate's goal.\nMay Kluc be with you stranger, take this ball duplicator, it will be of great help.

#line 587 
Hello prisoner.\nI am doctor Sactus, but you can call me Doc. This is my laboratory, where I build everything using Grimorn's metallic resources. The Retrofusor is here, you can have it. When you use it, be sure not to click using your middle finger, or else you will end up teleported to the center of Zambreze's supernova, which is very likely to have a bad influence on your molecular structure.\nI hope you've paid attention to my instructions! See you!

#line 588 
My name is Safori. I came to Nalikors after my home planet Karbonis exploded.\nI am now stuck on this planet. I'd like to work again: I'm an expert Archenior. I can rebuild any old machine if I have the blueprints and the needed material... Unfortunately, there is no project I can work on around here.\nThanks for your visit, see you soon!

#line 590 
Fantastic!!! Thanks to these tablets I'll finally have some work! Let's see... hmmmm this looks interesting indeed, like an ancient guidance system. I've got all I need here to build that. Don't move!\n............\n............\n............\n............\n............\n\nThere!\nIt's for you! Using this new guidance system, your envelope's radar range has been improved.\nThanks for the tablets, I'll keep them!!!\nMay the doors of Shamu open for you, my friend!

#line 592 
Hello prisoner, we have prepared your suit. Please fill in the DZ-578 form and leave your prints in this paper's A, B and C areas.\n...\nThank you\n...\nHere is your suit.\nGood luck.

Hello!\n

#line 630 
Welcome in my home!\n

#line 634 
Do you know how many planets are occupied or mined by humans in the universe? Over 35 million. 30% of these planets are operated by the ESCorp, which is now coming over to our system.\n

#line 635 
Since the ESCorp started to send its prisoners to our system, some planets like Tiboon or Lycans have been torn apart. Their dangerous experiments have even provoked Karbonis's explosion, a planet which was flourishing.\n

#line 636 
Ever since their arrival, their disregard for the natural laws provoked huge disasters. Karbonis's explosion, lower birthrate for Moltear's Glurts, pollution of Soupaline's ocean, all those tragedies are an abomination.\n

#line 637 
The ESCorp started its mining and carceral operations in this system over 30 years ago. Ever since their arrival, their disregard for the natural laws provoked huge disasters. Solar winds getting warmer, lower birthrate for Moltear's Glurts, all those tragedies are due to human expansion.\n

I can help you, companion! Take these :::rmin: minerals and use them wisely.\nIt's all I have left.

#line 641 
I have something to help you in your quest, my friend! Take these ::rcaps:: SHCs.\nThanks to you, our fight goes on!

The Foundation for the Unification in a Rational way of the Infinite (F.U.R.I),

#line 645 
suggests alternatives to allow all the universe's peoples to use space resources without damaging our universe's stellar biodiversity.

#line 646 
acts against uncontrolled human expansion by organizing sabotage missions in order to reduce big human corporations such as the ESCorp

#line 650 
Help!

#line 651 
You've made quite a sad choice, my friend.

#line 652 
Why so much hatred?

#line 653 
I suppose the ESCorp pays you well for this job...

#line 657 
Good luck to you!

#line 658 
Fulfill your destiny, human, save our universe!

#line 659 
May the doors of Shamu open for you!

On a routine hyperspace flight, I've seen strange pink glimmers at ::coord::, it's quite unusual at that speed, there must be something interesting over there.

#line 670 
An entire iron-cricket team

My uncle's space capsule

#line 672 
A complete Balixtean fleet

A squadron of 4 ESCorp prisoners' envelopes

#line 674 
A stellar whale weighing over 650 tons

#line 677 
has mysteriously been swallowed by a dark spot in space. My town's rescue team spent over a week looking around area ::coord::, but they found nothing.

#line 679 
I survived Karbonis's explosion, but my entire family perished there. The remains of our civilization now float in space... *sob*. While exploring the asteroid belt I found a Karbonite tablet at ::coord::. I couldn't take it with me because it was way too heavy.

#line 681 
They say the ESCorp is working on an extremely powerful drilling ball in the Stuklie system, far to the south-east of ours.\nThey should be sending their results soon.

#line 684 
A few space riots have been organized by the FURI. Last year, a delegation of over 350 representatives managed to get an audience with the human confederation's president on Earth.

#line 685 
I will never see my Karbonis friends again. Leave me alone. You humans are unable to understand what really is valuable.

#line 686 
Nebulae are so bright that they often bother some pilots' navigation. However, us pilots never move without using sunglasses.

#line 687 
I hate compote.

#line 688 
In the universe, there are some conglomerates that are so powerful that they can invert your senses.

#line 689 
Last year, my vacation on Samosa was horrible, in a week we haven't seen a single sunny day!

#line 690 
The bunny-robots never managed to enter our system. I think people should complain less about the ESCorp, since humans got here there hasn't been a single war!

#line 691 
A bunny-robot patrol took my grandmother 28 years ago, we never saw her again... It's quite difficult to say, but I must admit that the ESCorp's presence contributed to our system's security.

#line 694 
While I was wandering around area ::coord::, I saw a shredded missile wreck.\n

#line 696 
Space has really become a dump.

#line 697 
Young people really have no respect for anything...

#line 698 
I hope the waste collectors were able to pick it up.

#line 699 
I didn't get close by fear of an explosion.

#line 700 
It was in a very bad shape.
