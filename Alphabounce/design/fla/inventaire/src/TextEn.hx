		// Moltear
		"Rocky planet with a high molecular parasite activity. Old Zonkerian colony, many ruins can be seen in the southern hemisphere.",

		// soupaline
		"Planet having similar characteristics to the Earth's. A standard terraformation procedure has recently been launched by ESCorp in order to set up a drilling colony in the near future.",

		// Lycans
		"Giant volcanic planet, the high concentration of poutractive conglomerates makes its exploration dangerous.",

		// Samosa
		"The bulkiest planet of the Zonkerian system. Its incredible density and its exceptional gravity transform any mining operation into an endless race of endurance.",

		// Tiboon
		"Small-sized, desertic planet. Little mining resources are exploitable.",

		// Balixt
		"Home planet of a highly technologically advanced extraterrestrial race. Being quite xenophobic, Balixteans have posted sentinels all through and around their territory, and will not tolerate any intrusions.",

		// Karbonis
		"The explosion of the principal reactor of a gigantic mining industry caused Karbonis' heart to become unstable, and was followed by its implosion. An asteroid belt was created around the Zonkerian system called the \"Karbonis belt\".",

		// Spignysos
		"Spignysos' surface temperature never exceeds -50Â°C. Icy winds on the surface alter any envelope's orientation matrix and make space mining more difficult. We call this phenomenon \"spignysian stasis\".",

		// Pofiak
		"The presence of water and the temperate climate on Pofiak allowed tropical jungles to grow on its entire surface. Psionic insects can parasite your envelope's orientation matrix.",

		// Senegarde
		"Gaseous planet. The presence of saturated frugi-nitrogen creates an incredibly fertile field for parasite molecules. They develop faster here than anywhere else.",

		// Douriv
		"This planet is extremely rich in minerals, 75% of its surface is crystalized or in the process of crystalization. Naturally, it's the favorite destination of all space miners. Sadly, psionic insects infest the richest regions of Douriv.",

		// Grimorn
		"It is a dead planet, its ground is poor and the presence of metallic conglomerates prevent any intensive mining.",

		// D-Tritus
		"Dump planet where great monsters reside. They are organized in society and live by operating a planet in another galaxy. The technology that allows them to travel so far is still unknown.",

		// Asteroide
		"Karbonis' asteroid belt: the old planet exploded which created a vast asteroid field...",

		// Nalikors
		"A dry planet that has etheral vegetation. This planet is used as a rally point to all the anarchists of the universe. FURI is the represented movement, and it includes over 242 members in this sector.",

		// Holovan
		"An old rocky planet, the Kemilians' home planet, a more than 120,000 year old civilization. In the aim of not being disturbed, the Kemilians filled the sky with Kashuat sentinels.",

		// Khorlan
		"A grassy and comfortable planet. It is a friendly place to live in, several settlers decided to flee their galaxy's political problems and reach Khorlan. Only orbital-nut falls disturb their peaceful lives.",

		// Cilorile
		"A planet with water and breathable atmosphere, Cilorile is avoided by most miners because of its guardian conglomerates. Their contact causes an immediate explosion of the envelope.",

		// Tarciturne
		"This planet was devastated several years ago by a meteorite shower.",

		// Chagarina
		"A limestone planet which died a few milleniums ago. Its advanced crystalization and its location far away in the Zonkerian system make it a premium destination for the miners.",

		// Volcer
		"Planet with large dimensions, having enough water to provide shelter for various life forms. Even with a difficult access, Volcer attracts thousands of tourists coming from all surrounding systems every year.",

		// Balmanch
		"Spiky-limestone planet of the voceronic type. The atmosphere's high starch saturation has caused a proliferation of orbital-nuts. Today, only high-skilled pilots can fly over Balmanch without risking an immediate crash.",

		// Folket
		"Gaseous planet. Folket's core implosion over twenty thousand years ago led to a perpetual chlorine clay vaporization of its ground. The surface slicks' high acidity prevents envelopes lacking strong shields to reach its center.",
